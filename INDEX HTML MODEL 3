<p class="para3"> Fish can communicate in 

their underwater environments through the 

use of acoustic communication. Acoustic 

communication in fish involves the 

transmission of acoustic signals from one 

individual of a species to another. The 

production of sounds as a means of 

communication among fish is most often used 

in the context of feeding, aggression or 

courtship behaviour.[5] The sounds emitted 

by fish can vary depending on the species 

and stimulus involved. They can produce 

either stridulatory sounds by moving 

components of the skeletal system, or can 

produce non-stridulatory sounds by 

manipulating specialized organs such as the 

swimbladder. </p>
